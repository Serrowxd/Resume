# Notes

* UpperBody will break and crash down through the bottom, possibly related to the way it was organized with Row? Might need to set breakpoints. The upper part of the page breaks upon hitting a nearly phone-sized layout, will need to remove the qualifications but leave the Name. Will also need to create set the cards to be % based for height/width to help the page become more reactive, then possibly some modifications to the margin itself.

* Adjust the skills to be quicker to load - typing the name and finisher is fine, but typing all the skills is rather painstaking, make it faster.

* Remove the Nav but underlay the nav buttons themselves while keeping the same effects.

* Make the snowfall variable by breakpoints.

## Ideas

* Website code being written across the backgrounded, faded in, similar to how the snowfall works.
