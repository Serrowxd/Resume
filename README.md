## 4/10/2018:

UpperBody will break and crash down through the bottom, possibly related to the way it was organized with Row? Might need to set breakpoints. The upper part of the page breaks upon hitting a nearly phone-sized layout, will need to remove the qualifications but leave the Name. Will also need to create set the cards to be % based for height/width to help the page become more reactive, then possibly some modifications to the margin itself.
